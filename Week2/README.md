1. Go to DockerHub (Links to an external site.) and find an interesting docker project and start it up. Run the hello world of that technology and write about what you thought.

2. Volume map a docker container and write some code against it.  You could, for example, spin up a multi-note Kafka Cluster (Links to an external site.) and add docker exec into it and put messages into  a Topic.  Or you could spin up Kafka and connect it to the Wiki stream and use some KSQL to write data back to put data back to a topic (see tutorial below).  Submit your code and dockerfile for full credit.
